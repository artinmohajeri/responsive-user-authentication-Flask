# full user authentication app using flask.

### In this project, you can signup, login, logout, update and delete your account(and it handels all the exeptions).
### You can even add post to the page and delete your own post.
### I have made the frontend using HTML5, Bootstrap5 (no css, no js). and it is responsive!
